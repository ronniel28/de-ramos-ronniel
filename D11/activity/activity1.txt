// Step 1: Create a new MongoDB Atlas cluster and connect to it using MongoDB Compass .

// Step 2: In MongoDB Compass, create a new database called "Bookstore" and a collection called "Books".

// Step 3: Perform the following CRUD operations using MongoDB Compass:

// a) Create Operation:
// Insert at least three book documents with different fields such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
> db.Books.insertMany([
    {
        title: "The 1st Book",
        author: "Author One",
        genre: "Novel",
        publishYear: 2000
    },
    {
        title: "The 2nd Book",
        author: "Author Two",
        genre: "Drama",
        publishYear: 2001
    },
    {
        title: "The 3rd Book",
        author: "Author Three",
        genre: "Fiction",
        publishYear: 2002
    }
])

// b) Read Operation:
// Retrieve all the book documents in the "Books" collection.
> db.Books.find()

// Retrieve a specific book document based on its title or author.
> db.Books.find({title:"The 3rd Book"},{_id:0})
> db.Books.find({author:"Author One"},{_id:0})

// c) Update Operation:
// Update the genre of a book document.
> db.Books.updateOne({title:"The 3rd Book"},{$set: { genre: "Horror" }})

// Update the publication year of a book document.
> db.Books.updateOne({title:"The 1st Book"},{$set: { publishedYear: 2024 }})

// d) Delete Operation:
// Delete a book document based on its title or author.
> db.Books.deleteOne({title:"The 2nd Book"})

// Step 4: After each operation, verify the changes by re-reading the data from the "Books" collection.

// Note: Remember to clean up the cluster and delete the "Bookstore" database if no longer needed.
